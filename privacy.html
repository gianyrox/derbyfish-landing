        <p>DerbyFish ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide while using our mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use DerbyFish, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

        <h3>1. Device Permissions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> We request access to your device's camera to enable features such as capturing photos or videos within the App.</li>
            <li><strong>External Storage Access:</strong> We request access to your device's external storage to save, retrieve, or manage media files (photos, videos, etc.) generated or used by the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about your device, such as its operating system, device model, and unique identifiers, may be collected to improve the App's performance and functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable the core functionality of the App (e.g., capturing photos or videos)</li>
            <li>Allow users to save, retrieve, or manage media files on external storage</li>
            <li>Improve the App's performance and user experience</li>
            <li>Provide support and respond to user inquiries</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>DerbyFish may use third-party services that may collect data for analytics, crash reporting, or functionality improvements. These services are governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>

      
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>At AG Farms, we take the protection of your personal data seriously and employ reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include the use of encryption, secure servers, and other security practices designed to keep your data safe. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data. We strive to implement commercially acceptable security measures, but there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information over the internet.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Storage and Processing:</strong><br>
        We store your data on secure servers hosted by trusted service providers, such as Supabase, which employs industry-standard encryption protocols to protect your data during both storage and transmission.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Access Control:</strong><br>
        Only authorized personnel have access to your personal data. Access is granted based on the specific needs of our employees or contractors, and is managed through role-based access control systems, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
        
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You have control over the information and permissions you share with the App. Within your device settings, you can manage the app’s access to features like your camera, external storage, location, and more. Please be aware that denying access to certain features, such as the camera or storage, may limit the functionality of the App, preventing certain features from working as intended.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Managing Permissions:</strong><br>
        - <strong>Camera Access:</strong> You can choose to disable the App's camera access. However, doing so may prevent you from using features that require the camera.<br>
        - <strong>External Storage Access:</strong> You can manage access to external storage in your device settings, which may affect how the App saves or loads files from external storage.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.</p>
        
        <p>If you believe we have mistakenly collected data from a child under 13, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:team@agfarms.dev">team@agfarms.dev</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, or legal requirements. Any updates to this policy will be posted within the App, and the revised version will be effective immediately upon posting.</p>
        
        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the App after any modifications to this policy will signify your acceptance of those changes.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Deletion Request</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data. If you wish to have your data deleted from our systems, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto:team@agfarms.dev">team@agfarms.dev</a>. We will promptly process your request in compliance with applicable laws, and we will notify you once your data has been deleted.</p>
        
        <p>Please note that in certain circumstances, we may be required by law to retain certain data for a specific period before it can be fully deleted. In such cases, we will inform you of the retention requirements.</p>
